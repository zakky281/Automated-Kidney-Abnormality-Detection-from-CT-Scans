# Automated Kidney Abnormality Detection from CT Scans

This project uses a deep learning approach to detect kidney abnormalities (Normal, Cyst, Tumor, and Stone) from CT scan images. Built with Python and powered by a ResNet50 model, the application includes a Streamlit-based web interface for user-friendly interaction.

## üß† Overview

- **Dataset**: [CT Kidney Dataset (Normal, Cyst, Tumor, and Stone)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone)
- **Model**: Transfer learning with ResNet50
- **Interface**: Web-based GUI using Streamlit
- **Environment**: Python virtual environment
- **Goal**: Classify CT kidney images into one of four categories to assist in early diagnosis and reduce manual errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kidney-ct-detection.git
cd kidney-ct-detection
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Upload a CT scan image through the GUI and get real-time predictions.

2. **Train the Model**
```bash
python train_resnet.py
```

if you want to train baseline model
```bash
python train_baseline.py
```

3. **Evaluate Model**
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
